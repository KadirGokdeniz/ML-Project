# IEEE Conference - Machine Learning Project
This repository contains the code, dataset, academic paper, and presentation for the IEEE Conference on Machine Learning project titled "Apple Revenue Prediction Using Logistic Regression."

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to analyze and predict Apple's revenue based on historical data using logistic regression models. The project includes two Python scripts, 78accuracy.py and 99accuracy.py, which implement logistic regression with varying techniques to achieve different levels of accuracy. Additionally, the repository includes the dataset file, applerevenue.csv, which contains 10,560 rows of information covering the period from 1980 to 2022. The project also features an academic paper, IEEE-Conf-Paper.pdf, which provides a comprehensive explanation of the project, resembling a scholarly research article. Furthermore, a presentation, IEEE-Conf-Presentation.pptx, is available to provide a concise overview of the project and its findings.

## Files
1. 78accuracy.py: This Python script utilizes logistic regression to predict Apple's revenue based on the historical data provided in the applerevenue.csv file. By applying logistic regression techniques, the script achieves an accuracy of approximately 78%. Additionally, it generates a confusion matrix to visualize the performance of the model.
2. 99accuracy.py: This Python script builds upon the previous 78accuracy.py script by incorporating hyperparameter tuning and data shuffling. As a result, it achieves a higher accuracy of around 99% and generates a confusion matrix to evaluate the model's performance.
3. applerevenue.csv: This CSV file contains the historical revenue data of Apple, spanning from 1980 to 2022. The dataset consists of 10,560 rows, providing valuable information for training and evaluating the logistic regression models.
4. IEEE-Conf-Paper.pdf: This document serves as an academic paper, providing an in-depth explanation of the project methodology, including data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation. The paper also presents the experimental results and discusses the implications of the findings.
5. IEEE-Conf-Presentation.pptx: This PowerPoint presentation offers a concise summary of the project, highlighting its objectives, methodology, and key outcomes. It is designed to be used for presentations or discussions related to the project.
## Getting Started
To reproduce the results or further explore the project, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command: git clone https://github.com/mehmetalpayy/IEEE-Conferance-Machine-Learning.git
Ensure that you have Python installed on your machine.
Run the Python scripts:
- For 78accuracy.py, execute the following command:
Copy code
- python 78accuracy.py
This script will utilize logistic regression to predict Apple's revenue based on the applerevenue.csv dataset, achieving an accuracy of approximately 78%. The resulting confusion matrix will be displayed.
For 99accuracy.py, execute the following command:
Copy code
- python 99accuracy.py
This script incorporates hyperparameter tuning and data shuffling to achieve a higher accuracy of around 99%. The resulting confusion matrix will be displayed.
Review the generated confusion matrices to assess the accuracy and performance of the logistic regression models.
